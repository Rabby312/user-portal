# Grails Project for User Portal
---

**[Grails](https://www.grails.org/)**  is an open source web application **(MVC)** framework that uses the **Apache Groovy** programming language 
(which is in turn based on the Java platform). It is intended to be a high-productivity framework by following the **coding by convention** 
paradigm, providing a stand-alone development environment and hiding much of the configuration detail from the developer.
